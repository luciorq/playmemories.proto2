# playmemories for desktop (new)

This is a quick and dirty python application that allows my 2 Sony Lens-Style DSC-QX 10 & 100 cameras to use on my laptop.

I learned from this this website (https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/)

$ git clone https://github.com/loouislow81/playmemories.proto2.git
```

## _run

connect your computer and the camera on the same WiFi connection,

run the application in Python Virtual Environment,

```bash
$ cd playmemories.proto2
$ source venv/activate
$ (playmemories.proto2) ./playmemories.py
```

to exit the Python Virtual Environment,

```bash
$ (playmemories.proto1) deactivate
```
